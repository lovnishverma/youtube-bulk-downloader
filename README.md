## üóÉÔ∏è Project Structure

```
youtube-bulk-downloader/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downloads/                  # Downloaded videos go here (auto-created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video_urls.txt              # Your list of YouTube URLs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ youtube_bulk_downloader.py # The main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                  # Ignores __pycache__, downloads, etc.
```

* Reads URLs from `video_urls.txt`
* Uses `yt-dlp`'s Python API to download each video
* Handles exceptions gracefully
* Saves all videos in a local `downloads/` folder
